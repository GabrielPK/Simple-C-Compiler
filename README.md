# Simple C Compiler
Project for a compilers class in college (leaving the name out so current students don't "accidentally" find it.)

This is a compiler for the Simple C programming language. Simple C is a subset of the C programming language. Every legal Simple C program is a legal C program and can be compiled using a traditional C compiler. 

This compiler is implemented in C++.
